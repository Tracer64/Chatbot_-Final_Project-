# Chatbot_-Final_Project-

I am planning on making a semi-full interactive chatbot with responses around general questions to ask as if you’re talking to a stranger you just met and asking about their life and what they’re like. Also asking about the Bot’s background with very simple details and he or she (haven’t decided yet) will have a name and what his/her life is based around (again basic details). I will plan to make a somewhat type of library sending out random questions at a time and then responses for each of the questions. I’ll most likely make a few responses for each question based on how in depth the answer expected and possibly make around 15 questions or maybe a little less based on how advanced I want it to be (I’ll decide when I’m making the bot. Just enough for the user to have a decent conversation. If then they want to carry on another conversation, I will put in a word like “Quit” or “quit” to end it and the bot will then give an ending greeting and then it will ask you to restart the code to have another conversation.
